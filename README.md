## Participate

Submit solution and proof evidence using the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
Before opening a PR that submits a Lean proof, run the repository's
[`lean-verify` skill](skills/lean-verify/SKILL.md) on the exact proof commit and
obtain a **Verification passed** result. Declare the completed self-check in the
PR with the commit, date, conclusion and a short summary. Full report and log
links are recommended; see the [pre-submission check](docs/verification.md#required-lean-pre-submission-check).
Verification and merge start **14 days of public review for each contribution role**
when an accepted formalization source is available. Open a claim-award issue and
complete identity checks alongside the review. Solvers awaiting formalization may
register an application; their review starts once formalization is available.
Raise candidate or award challenges through the Formal dispute issue form and
ordinary record corrections through the Correction issue form. Submit replacement
proofs or catalog updates in a linked PR. Written recipient confirmation precedes announcement and delivery of prize
money and a medal. Follow the [complete award process](docs/award-process.md) and
[public notice table](candidates/public-notice.md).

You can recommend a problem, claim an award for your own contribution, correct a record, or raise a dispute using the four [issue forms](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). Award claims must be submitted by the actual contributor. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for evidence requirements and handling steps, and follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Keep identity documents, private contact details and other private personal information out of public issues.
