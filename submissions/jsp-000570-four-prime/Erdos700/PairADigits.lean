/-- Full integer exclusion for the pair `(P+a,P+b)`, with `q=P+b`.

The three target hypotheses are actual Euclidean remainders of `k/q`, not
presupposed normalized coefficients. The four explicit size hypotheses
are weaker than the global `P >= 100*c^5` condition in the paper. The
source divisibility `q | k/(P+a)` is the input obtained from the two
prime divisibilities and coprimality; no primality is used in this lemma.
