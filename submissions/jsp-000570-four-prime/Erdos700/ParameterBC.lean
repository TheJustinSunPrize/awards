/-!
The `(P+b,P+c)` exclusion with the original parameters and source digit bounds.
All auxiliary size hypotheses of `PairBC.source_pair_exclusion_of_large_base`
are discharged here from the uniform parameter assumptions.

/-- No positive integer has the source digit bounds for `P+b`, a source
quotient divisible by `P+c`, and the target low and middle digit bounds for
`P+c`, under the four-prime construction's original parameter inequalities.

This is an integer arithmetic theorem.  Primality is not needed once the
source representation, divisibility, and target digit inequalities have been
obtained.  No auxiliary normalized-digit or size hypothesis is required.
