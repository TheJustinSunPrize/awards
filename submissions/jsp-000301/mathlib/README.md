# JSP-000301 — consecutive nonsquare powerful numbers

**Submission for review:** this package provides an additional mathlib-based
implementation alongside [the earlier PR #13](https://github.com/TheJustinSunPrize/awards/pull/13).
It does not claim first-formalization priority. See [SUBMISSION.md](SUBMISSION.md)
for the pinned source archive, attribution, intake request, and review limitations.

A Lean formalization of the **already-known** counterexample
`12167, 12168`. This is not a claim of a new mathematical discovery,
first formalization, accepted submission, or entitlement to prize money.

**Verified locally on 2026-09-16:** Lean build, kernel replay, expanded-statement
inspection, and the axiom audit all passed. See `VERIFICATION.md` and the raw
log in `evidence/verification.txt`.

## Exact scope

The prize record asks:

> If two consecutive positive integers are powerful, must at least one be a
> perfect square?

The answer is **no**. A positive integer is powerful when the square of every
prime divisor divides it. In this project, `Powerful` uses mathlib's `Nat.Prime`
and ordinary natural-number divisibility. Perfect squares use mathlib's
`IsSquare`, with a natural-number witness.

The final theorem is `JSP301.jsp_000301 : ¬ JSP301.Claim`.
`JSP301.jsp_000301_expanded` spells out the same statement without the local
definitions. Quantifiers over prime divisors and square roots are **unbounded**.

This proves precisely the yes/no question in the scoped catalog record.
It does **not** prove an asymptotic counting result, an infinitude result,
or the distinct question in Erdős problem 365.

## Proof

1. `12167 = 23³` is powerful: every prime divisor of a cube divides its base,
   so its square divides the cube.
2. `12168 = 2³ × 39²` is powerful: positive squares and cubes are powerful,
   and the product of powerful numbers is powerful.
3. `110² = 12100 < 12167 < 12168 < 12321 = 111²`.
   No natural-number square lies strictly between successive squares.
4. The consecutive pair therefore disproves the universal assertion.

This uses ordinary proof-producing arithmetic tactics. The main proof does
not rely on a finite search over all candidate primes or square roots.

## Pinned dependencies

- Lean: `leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0`.
- mathlib: `5ed2965256430c3649e86755f9576b54eca72435` (release `v4.34.0`).
- Transitive dependency revisions: `lake-manifest.json`.

Install elan and let `lean-toolchain` select the pinned Lean release.
The wrapper also supports an optional project-local installation under
`.tooling/`; that installation is not included in this repository. The
macOS release used for the attached verification evidence was checked against
the SHA-256 digest saved in `evidence/lean-release.json`.

## Reproduce

From the project directory:

```sh
./scripts/lake.sh exe cache get \
  Mathlib.Data.Nat.Prime.Basic \
  Mathlib.Algebra.Group.Even
./scripts/verify.sh
```

The source proof is in `JSP301/Proof.lean`; the statement and axiom audit is
in `JSP301/Audit.lean`. Verification includes a separate `leanchecker` replay
of the local proof declarations and rejects any transitive axioms other than
Lean's standard `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
It also rejects proof placeholders and native-evaluation shortcuts in the
local Lean source. `leanchecker` uses the same Lean kernel; it is not an
independently implemented verifier. Cached upstream mathlib artifacts are used in the
standard way. This is not an independent bootstrap of Lean or rebuild of
all of mathlib from source.

## Attribution and prize status

The pair and argument were already listed by **The Justin Sun Prize
contributors**. The exact source revision and an extracted record are retained
in `evidence/problem-statement.md`. Only formalization work is new in this
project. An earlier submission for the same result exists as PR #13; no
first-formalization priority is claimed.

At the captured revision the record says `Lean proof: No`,
`Eligible to claim: No`, and lists no bounty amount. A local kernel check does
not change those official fields, establish priority, or authorize payment.
This package requests official review of the formalization and its verification
evidence. It is not an accepted candidate or award. Recipient confirmation,
independent review, eligibility assessment, and payment verification remain
pending. No official eligibility flag or award record is changed here.
