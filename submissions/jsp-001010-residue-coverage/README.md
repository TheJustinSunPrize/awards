# JSP-001010: Choosing one residue class for each permitted modulus, what minimum coverage multiplicity can be achieved throughout the specified integer interval?

## Problem

This submission formalizes specific covering systems and their multiplicities, the Chinese Remainder Theorem for small cases, and minimum coverage bounds.

## Formalization

This file provides Lean 4 formalization of scoped components of the problem.
All theorems are proved using `decide` (native decision procedures) with no
axioms or `sorry`.

## Build

```bash
lake build Erdos1010
```

## Verification
