# JSP-000428: How large can a pairwise noncoprime subset of an integer interval containing a specified integer be?

## Problem

This submission formalizes specific pairwise noncoprime subsets of small integer intervals, verifies gcd properties, and checks the structure of maximal noncoprime subsets.
